# Roadmap

This is an outline of plans the core FAIRDOM-SEEK development team will be working on in the near future.

It is an overview of the main priorities, and milestones. FAIRDOM-SEEK is developed following an Agile development process, meaning some of the features and timing may change - however, these items are very high in our priorities. 

They are expected to be added to FAIRDOM-SEEK in roughly the order they are presented here.

| Feature | Milestone date |

| Extended integration with the Norwegian e-Infrastructure for Life Sciences (NeLS) system | Q1 2025        |
| Rails 7 and Ruby 3.2 upgrades | Q1 2025        |
| Ability to Merge accounts | Q2 2025        |
| UI Improvements to the Admin area | Q2 2025        |

| JERM RO-Crate profile and support for snapshots, export and import | Q2 2025        |
| RO-Crate profile to support Collections | Q2 2025        |
| Enhanced ISA-JSON export (via DataHub) supporting brokering tools to submit to repositories | Q2 2025        |
| Harmonize and tidy up the submission forms, and remove the DataFile upload wizard to improve consistency | Q2 2025        |
| Visible history log for Sample changes | Q2 2025        |
| Improving search to support more advanced queries | Q2 2025        |
