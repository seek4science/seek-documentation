There are two ways to create an Extended Metadata type:

* [Using a SEED File](create-extended-metadata-type-with-seeds-file): Run a SEED file in the backend to define the metadata type.

* [Uploading a JSON File](create-extended-metadata-type-with-json-file): Upload a JSON file through the Admin Area UI to create the metadata type.
