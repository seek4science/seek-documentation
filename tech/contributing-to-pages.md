## Editing and adding pages

These pages can be found in GitHub at [https://github.com/seek4science/seek-documentation](https://github.com/seek4science/seek-documentation). Pages are in [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) format, with a _.md_ extension, but get converted into HTML for you.
New pages require a formatter at the top, that looks like:
```yaml
---
title: my lovely page
---
```

For example, this page can be found at [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seek4science/seek-documentation/main/tech/contributing-to-pages.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seek4science/seek-documentation/main/tech/contributing-to-pages.md).

The **home, user guide, and technical guide pages** use a remote theme called [ELIXIR Toolkit Theme](https://elixir-belgium.github.io/elixir-toolkit-theme/) (ETT). The ETT theme provides additional support for styling and navigation, including the sidebar menus. The _title_ metadata is used to create a first-level heading at the top of the page. Do not include it again. Instead, use `##` and `###` for subheadings (second- and third-level, respectively).

The site can be served from a root domain/sub-domain (for example, `docs.site.com`) or from a directory (for example, `site.com/docs`). To support sites that are served from a directory, all links to pages within the site must be given as relative paths, not absolute paths. We use a [Jekyll filter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/filters/) to achieve this, for example:
```
{% raw %}Please visit our [Contributors guide]({{ "/tech/contributing" | relative_url }}).{% endraw %}
```

All links to images within the site must also be given as relative paths (with alt description), for example:
```
{% raw %}![Registration 1]({{ "/images/user-guide/register_1.png" | relative_url }}){:.screenshot}{% endraw %}
```

To add your new page to the sidebar, add a line to the data file:
`_data` &#9658; `sidebars` &#9658; `user_guide.yml` or `technical_guide.yml`.
More details are available from the [ETT theme documentation](https://elixir-belgium.github.io/elixir-toolkit-theme/navigation_structures).
