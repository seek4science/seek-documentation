(Alias "Single Page")

A Project and the associated Experiments (Investigation, Study, Assay) can be visualised in "Experiment View" by selecting the button “Experiment View” at the top right corner of the page.

{% include callout.html type="note" content="The \"Experiment View\" feature must be enabled by the instance administrator." %}

In Experiment View, Experiments (Investigation, Study, Assay) compliant to the ISA framework (ISA-JSON compliant: true) display their Samples and linked protocols in a tree view on the left side of the page. Each item's details are shown and accessible from the center of the page, and as more items are added, the tree will expand.
