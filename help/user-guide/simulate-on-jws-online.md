title: Simulating Models with JWS Online
---

Models uploaded to SEEK in SBML format can be simulated in SEEK using [JWS Online](http://jjj.mib.ac.uk/).

To run a model on JWS Online you need to click the Simulate Model on JWS button. 

![run model on jws]({{ "/images/user-guide/run_model_JWS.png" | relative_url }}){:.screenshot}

The interface in SEEK will change to the JWS run environment. In this environment you are able to run a range of analysis on the model including steady state, control analysis, flux balance analysis, and more. 
You can find out more about the JWS interface [here](http://jws-docs.readthedocs.io/)
