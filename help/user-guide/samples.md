## Introduction

Samples in SEEK refer to a broad category 


Definitions: 


* **Sample**: ​entity (material or data) that is converted into a new item (material or data) via a process (physical or computational). 
* **Material Sample**: ​refers to a physical sample in the laboratory, examples include cell pellets, 
extracted biological material (DNA, protein, metabolites, patient, organism, tissue), plasmids, etc. 
* **Data Sample**: ​refers to digital objects, these can include machine data from analysis of material samples, models, 
descriptions of plasmids, DNA sequences in digital format, Mass Spec Spectra, Gene Strings, 
* **Process**: ​refers to defined activities (experimental protocols, data analysis, algorithms etc) that can be defined, 
explained and reported, that convert one sample into another. In essence this is an experiment. 
A process can only occur if a protocol and/or a standard operating procedure is associated with it.
