## Using the wizard

The wizard is split into a series of steps. These steps can be progressed by clicking the "Next" button, or the "Back" to return to an earlier step.

You can also use the cursor keys (&larr; &rarr;) to go backwards and forwards.

You can also jump straight to the end or back to the start by clicking the "End" or "Start" buttons, or by pressing the "End" or "Home" keys, respectively.
