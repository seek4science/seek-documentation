## Publications
If your asset is directly related to a publication you can link the two together in SEEK. You can select publications within your project form the drop-down menu. If the publication is in another project you need to check the box that says associate publications from other projects.

When a publication is added a preview will be shown in the bottom right hand corner of SEEK. It can be removed easily if needed.

![add publication 2]({{ "/images/user-guide/add_publication_2.png" | relative_url }}){:.screenshot}
