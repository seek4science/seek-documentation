title: Investigations

The [ISA metadata framework](https://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isamodel.html) requires the description (metadata) of different types of samples, namely Study Sources, Study Samples and Assay Samples. This description is based on customisable Experiment Sample Templates and includes the linking of applied Protocols. Follow the link for an overview about [ISA-JSON compliant experiments](isa-json-compliant-experiment.html).

In the context of an ISA-JSON compliant experiment, we use the terms ISA Investigation, ISA Study, and ISA Assay when referring to Investigation, Study, and Assay, respectively.

## 1. Creating an ISA Investigation
Select
* Create Investigation from header menu bar.
* Alternatively, in Experiment View, select the Design Investigation button at the top right corner

Fill out the provided form, check the option for "Make Investigation compliant to ISA-JSON schemas?" and then click the 'Create' button.
