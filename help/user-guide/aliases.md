title: Aliases across FAIRDOM-SEEK instances
---

FAIRDOM-SEEK instances are highly customisable. Functionality such as e.g. the ISA structure, ISA-JSON compliant experiments and the different asset types need to be enabled by an instance admin. Therefore, some functionality described in this general user guide might not be available on your local instance.

The names of different features and functions may vary across FAIRDOM-SEEK instances. This general user guide includes the default or most common names. Below is a look-up list for the most common names that are included in the user guide, and what they may be called in a different instance. Note, this list is not complete.
