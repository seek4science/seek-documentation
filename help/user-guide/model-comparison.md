title: Comparing two versions of a Model
---


If a model has a number of versions, you can compare between two versions to see what was changed.

You can only compare versions if you are logged into SEEK.

![two versions]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/user-guide/two_versions-zoomed.png){:.screenshot}

Scroll down to the Version History towards the end of the page, and click _Compare_.

![compare versions]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/user-guide/compare_versions.png){:.screenshot}

You will then be given the option to choose the models that you want to compare:

![which versions]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/user-guide/which_versions_to_compare.png){:.screenshot}

SEEK then returns a list, and diagram containing the differences.
Deletions appear in red, additions in blue, and updates that do not affect the network are in yellow.

![version diff]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/user-guide/version_diff.png){:.screenshot}

SEEK uses [BiVES](https://sems.uni-rostock.de/projects/bives/) to compare the different models.
