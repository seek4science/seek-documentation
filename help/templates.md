SEEK have been developing a collection of JERM templates to facilitate standard formats for sharing the same kinds of data through the consortium. This page lists the current templates available, although we are always looking to update and add to them with help from the community.

## Contributing 
SEEK templates are a community driven activity. If you have any updates, modifications or new templates you want to include for other to use, or if you just want to send feedback, then you can contact us at <community@fair-dom.org>.

#### SOPs

* [Nature Protocols Format for SOPs](/attachments/NatureProtocolsFormat.doc)

#### Data

* [Master Template](https://fairdomhub.org/data_files/927)  

This is the general format for all SEEK templates. Each spreadsheet has multiple sheets, defining experimental metadata, organims/samples, data and optional sheets for instrument descriptions and results.  
This template can be refined and/or extended to cater more specifically for different data types.

##### Metabolomics

* [Master Metabolomics Template](https://fairdomhub.org/data_files/927)

This is a JERM compliant template for general use in metabolomics experiments

##### Transcriptomics

###### General Transcriptomics Templates

* [General Chip-chip Array](https://fairdomhub.org/data_files/931)  
A JERM compliant template based on a template taken from [GEO][3]  

* [RT-PCR](https://fairdomhub.org/data_files/930)  
A JERM compliant template based on a template taken from [GEO][3]

* [Gene Expression ArrayExpress](https://fairdomhub.org/data_files/8)  
A JERM compliant template based on the MAGE-TAB ArrayExpress format (metadata only)  

###### Affymetrix

* [3â€™ or Whole Gene Expression array](https://fairdomhub.org/data_files/928)  
A JERM compliant template based on a template taken from [GEO][3]  

* [Chip-chip Array](https://fairdomhub.org/data_files/929)  
A JERM compliant template for Chip-chip data based on a template taken from [GEO][3]

###### Nimblegen

* [Gene Expression](https://fairdomhub.org/data_files/933)  
A JERM compliant template based on a template taken from [GEO][3]  

##### Proteomics

* [Mass Spec JERM](https://fairdomhub.org/data_files/932)  
This MIAPE template was adapted from a template offered by the [PRIDE database][5] to conform to the SEEK JERM format. For proteomics data, the "Instrument" sheet is mandatory.

* [Gel Electrophoresis](https://fairdomhub.org/data_files/938)  
This is a MIAPE-GE template for use with 2D gel data
